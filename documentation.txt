Thank you for collaborating on the Alpha Kappa Psi website.
Feature list can be found at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AOxn7gJz_bfLhDZjplhwKAV5QDB14YdHQfE6OQPpW20/edit?usp=sharing
If you wish to make changes to the codebase, or add new features, please
follow these instructions:
1. Master branch is only to be merged into by the author (webmaster).
2. Production is the current branch hosted on netlify. It is the branch that all
   feature branches are ultimately merged into.
3. If you wish to modify a particular branch, checkout that particular feature branch,
   make a branch off this branch and use a descriptive name, for example"api/subscribe/bug_fixes". 
   If the feature branch does not exist, make a new feature branch from production using a name as 
   outlined above.
4. Once you have implemented your changes, test your changes for usability etc. on your local browser.
   Clean up your code, write some comments (if you haven't already), and submit a pull request on github.com
5. Once your code is reviewed, it will be merged into the production branch.
6. Remember the following- DO NOT clone the production branch and push commits to it, always make 
    your own branch. If you make any changes directly, remember to notify the webmaster.

Finally, if you have any repo-wide suggestions by the way of new technologies to use, feel free 
to email me at sathyah@andrew.cmu.edu

Once again, thank you for collaborating. Have fun!
